I did not have any perticular technical issues with this exercise. I had some issues with getting the frontend to show on port 8080, but realised this was because i was mapping to a default message from the earliest exercise.


You can find the code for this exercise under /frontend/svelte stuff/src. Here you will find the App.svelte file.

You can find the components (pollCreator.svelte and pollVoter.svelte) in /frontend/svelte stuff/src/components.


The project has no issues that i am aware off.
