Project rapport

In this exercise i have created domains with simple getters and setters, aswell as handlers to get the desired behaviour. 
The files can be found under src/main/java/Morten/Aagotnes/demo/domain and src/main/java/Morten/Aagotnes/demo/controllers.
I have also created two ways to test if everything works. The first way is to run the testing.http file using the Intellij http client.
This file is located under /Spring Boot/.
The second method is to import a Bruno collection that is found under src/test/java/Morten/Aagotnes/demo/test. The file is named Exercise2tests.json

I had no technical difficulties downloading the required resources needed to complete the assignment.

I have had some issues with how to implement the automatic tests. I was and still am unsure if the way i did it is right, or if the tests is meant to run automatically when you run the application.
Running the Bruno collection at least makes assertions about the response you should get when you make the different http requests, and it should be easy to see if it works as it should.
